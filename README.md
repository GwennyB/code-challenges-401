CF 401 .NET - Code Challenges

## Introduction
This is a set of solutions for assigned code challenges that focus on learning and practicing data structures and algorithms.

## Format
Each challenge has its own directory (with descriptive name). Each directory contains a README.md describing the challenge and the approach. Most are planned on a whiteboard (with a partner), an image of which can be found in the challenge's 'assets' directory. Each directory contains a solution built in VS2017 Community Edition.
